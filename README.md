##  Description
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Superstore's retail sales data using SQL for querying and Power BI for visualization. The objective is to uncover critical business insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, regional profitability, and operational efficiency.

The final dashboard includes multiple interactive visuals such as KPI cards, time-series analysis, customer segmentation and geolocation-based profit analysis, enabling business stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

##  Key Insights
- **Peak Sales in Q4**: Sales significantly increase during November and December, indicating strong performance during holiday and promotional periods.
- **Revenue Concentration**: A small group of top customers generates a disproportionate share of total sales, revealing potential for focused retention strategies.
- **Discount-Driven Losses**: Products sold with discounts greater than 30% often result in negative profit margins, highlighting pricing inefficiencies.
- **Shipping Mode Impact**: Different shipping modes influence profitability â€” Standard Class and Second Class have varying profit outcomes and operational impacts.
- **Regional Profit Gaps**: Certain cities consistently underperform in terms of profit, suggesting areas for cost optimization or strategic focus.
- **Product-Level Performance**: Several products show high sales volumes but low or negative profits, emphasizing the need to balance volume with margin.
- **Category Trends**: Technology and Office Supplies dominate sales, while some furniture sub-categories lag behind, both in volume and profitability.
- **Inventory Insights**: High product quantity sold doesnâ€™t always correlate with high profitability â€” profitability must be tracked alongside volume.
